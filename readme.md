A simple browser-based Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Jiak Zhua translates to "eat snake" in Hokkien, a widely spoken dialect in Singapore. It's a playful phrase that means "slacking off." The name came to me when I realized I had been slacking off (or "Jiak Zhua-ing") while developing this game by constantly playing it. The name fits perfectly since the main gameplay revolves around controlling a snake that slides around eating food.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay with a growing snake.
- Responsive controls using arrow keys.
- Basic styling for the snake, with plans for more decorative designs.

## Technology

- Jiak Zhua is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move the snake up, down, left, and right.
- The snake will grow by 1 body unit each time it eats the watermelon.
- The snake will grow by 5 body unit each time it eats the donut.
- Your total score is the length of your snake.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body, or the game will end.
